== Venkat - An inline code snippet execution extension for VS Code (Made in GPT-4)

You might have seen https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=venkat+subramaniam[presentations^] by the legendary https://twitter.com/venkat_s[Venkat Subramaniam^] who is able to execute arbitrary code snippets and show the results as a tooltip directly in the editor.
This makes it really great for videos or talks as you don't need a second output terminal to run your code and you can just continue explaining what you're doing.
Also the results go away after so you don't need to worry about that.

He even published a https://www.agilelearner.com/presentation/5[dedicated free course^] from 2013, on how to achieve that with TextMate.

In his https://youtube.com/@learndatawithmark[LearnDataWithMark videos^] Mark wanted to use a similar effect, so we were unsuccessfully looking for a VS Code extension that does it.

So what else could we do at 10pm than *fire up ChatGPT4* to help us build a VS Code extension (and then in TypeScript), something we've never done before.
Simon Willison talks about this, where he explains that with GPT4 he takes on ambitious projects more quickly as they usually yield results in a few hours instead of a few days.

It did a really good job, guiding us through the initial setup and putting together a minimal example for executing selected python code.
Initially just passing the code directly to the interpreter and capturing the rsult.

Then we evolved it to run the whole file up to the current point, which made it necessary to write out the content to a file and execute that.
But this then opened up the opportunity to support different languages and not have to fiddle with escaping symbols to avoid shell expansion.

So two hours later we had a working prototype and were happy.

So GPT could help us with publishing the extension, which it did a great job of, much better job than Microsoft did with the registration and publication process.

The most tricky part was selecting an icon, but we think we did a great job at a that.

Now you can install https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MarkNeedham.venkat[Venkat from the VS Code marketplace^]. 

TODO proper example video

This was fun, so we continued to add a few more features - of course GPT-4 helped us with all the steps, because what do we know :)

* execute selection or code up to current line
* Language support for python, javascript, typescript, php, ruby, java, kotlin
* supports multiline outputs
* insert result as comment or show as info message (configurable)
* selects inserted result, so can be deleted or copied with a single keystroke
* configurable extra languages

We'd love for you all to try Venkat out, https://github.com/mneedham/venkat/issues[give us feedback^] or https://github.com/mneedham/venkat[contribute to the project^] (e.g. by adding extra languages or features)
