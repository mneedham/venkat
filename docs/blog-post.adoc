== Venkat - An inline code snippet execution extension for VS Code (Made in GPT-4)

https://twitter.com/venkat_s[Venkat Subramaniam^] is a legendary speaker on the tech conference circuit whose https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=venkat+subramaniam[presentations^] are famous for executing arbitrary code snippets and showing the results as a tooltip directly in the editor.
This makes it really great for videos or talks as you don't need a second output terminal to run your code and you can just continue explaining what you're doing.
The results go away afterwards so you don't need to worry about that.

He even published a https://www.agilelearner.com/presentation/5[dedicated free course^] back in 2013 explaining how he does it using the TextMate editor.

In his https://youtube.com/@learndatawithmark[LearnDataWithMark videos^], Mark wanted to use a similar effect, but couldn't find a VS Code extension that did the trick.

So what else could we do at 10pm than *fire up ChatGPT4* to help us build one ourselves. 
Keep in mind that we've never built a VS Code extension before, nore are we that good at Typescript.
We were following in the footsteps of Simon Willisons, https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/27/ai-enhanced-development/[who pointed out^] that with the assistance of GPT4, he's now able to take on and complete ambitious projects in a few hours instead of a few days.

ChatGPT did a really good job, guiding us through the initial setup and putting together a minimal example for executing Python python code.
The first version passed the code directly to the interpreter and captured the result.

We evolved it to run the whole file up to the end of the current line, which made it necessary to write out the content to a file and execute that file.
This design choice fortuitously opened up the opportunity to support different languages and not have to fiddle around with escaping symbols to avoid shell expansion.

Within two hourswe had a working prototype and were happy.

GPT also provided us with instructions to package and publish the extension.
Somewhat surprisingly, it also did a better job of explaining the registration and publication process than the official documentation.

The most tricky part was selecting an icon, but we think we came up with a good one in the end!

Now you can install https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MarkNeedham.venkat[Venkat from the VS Code marketplace^]. 

TODO proper example video

This was fun, so we continued to add a few more features - of course GPT-4 helped us with all the steps, because what do we know :)

* execute selection or code up to current line
* Language support for python, javascript, typescript, php, ruby, java, kotlin
* supports multiline outputs
* insert result as comment or show as info message (configurable)
* selects inserted result, so can be deleted or copied with a single keystroke
* configurable extra languages

We'd love for you all to try Venkat out, https://github.com/mneedham/venkat/issues[give us feedback^] or https://github.com/mneedham/venkat[contribute to the project^] (e.g. by adding extra languages or features)
