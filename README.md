# venkat

This is the README for the VS Code extension "venkat". 

It runs the example file up to the current line (or the selection) and displays the result of that last line in a comment after or for multi-line results below.

It is inspired by Venkat Subramaniam's use of Textmate tooltips for [code execution results](http://blog.agiledeveloper.com/2014/10/running-in-textmate.html) which is great for presentations.

## Features

* execute selection or code up to current line
* Language support for python, javascript, ruby, java
* supports multiline outputs
* selects result, so can be deleted or copied with a single keystroke
